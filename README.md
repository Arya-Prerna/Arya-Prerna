# Hi, I'm Prerna Arya! 👋
### Data Scientist | Business Intelligence Analyst | Python & SQL Developer

I bridge the gap between complex data and business strategy. Currently pursuing my **M.Sc. in Data Science** at Universität Trier, with professional experience in **Production Support Engineering** and **Product Analytics**. 

I specialize in building **automated data pipelines**, **cleaning "dirty" real-world datasets**, and creating **dashboards** that drive decision-making.
